# 1. Delete all album docs, if any:
DELETE /test/album

# 2. Figuring out how to tempt ES into guessing a wrong type is up to you, but
# here's how to make a new doc, for reference:
PUT /test/album/1
{
    "title": "Fish Sounds",
    "gapless_playback": true,
    "length_seconds": 210000,
    "weight": 1.22,
    "released": "2013-01-23"
}

# 3. How to get the mapping:
GET /test/album/_mapping

# 4. How to delete that album doc so we can change the bad mapping:
DELETE /test/album

# 5. How to set a mapping explicitly so you canâ€™t fool ES anymore. Here's a
# sample mapping to expand upon:
PUT /test/_mapping/album
{
  "properties" : {
    "length_seconds" : {
      "type" : "long"
    },
    "gapless_playback" : {
      "type" : "boolean"
    }
  }
}
