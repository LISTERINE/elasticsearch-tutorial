# Delete the album doctype so we start from a clean slate:
DELETE /test/album

# Trick ES into guessing incorrectly that title is a date. Some scalawag named
# his album "2001-01-01":
PUT /test/album/1
{
    "title": "2001-01-01"
}

# Future stringily-titled album inserts will fail:
PUT /test/album/2
{
    "title": "Hello There"
}

# Get the mapping to see the mistake:
GET /test/album/_mapping

# Delete the album doctype so we can change the mapping:
DELETE /test/album

# Set a mapping explicitly so you canâ€™t fool ES anymore:
PUT /test/_mapping/album
{
  "properties" : {
    "title" : {
      "type" : "string"
    }
  }
}

# Insert our 2 docs:
PUT /test/album/1

}

# Future stringily-titled album inserts will fail:
PUT /test/album/2
{
    "title": "Hello There"
